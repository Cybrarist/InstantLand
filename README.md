# Instant Land
Instant Land is a price tracker across multiple shopping websites simultaneously, and get notified when an item reaches the price you desire, so you don't have to keep checking shop stores for price changes.

# Documentation
Feel free to access the up-to-date documentation from [Here](https://instant-land.cybrarist.com)

## Deployment
Instant Land uses a web interface, so you need to install some dependencies first:
- php (https://www.php.net)
- composer (https://getcomposer.org)
- apache or nginx (https://httpd.apache.org , https://www.nginx.com)
- mysql (https://www.mysql.com)
- sqlite (Default Option)

or you can install something like MAMP instead of installing each one alone. (https://www.mamp.info/en/windows/)


first, you need to install the packages with composer
```bash
composer install 
```
